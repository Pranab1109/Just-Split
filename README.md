# Just_split

- A bill splitter app which splits the bill among a group with minimum required transactions.
- Users can create and join rooms, add bills in real-time in a room, split the bills on tap of a button.
- Implemented backtracking algorithm to find all possible transactions to split the bill and return the one with **minimum transactions** needed.
- Implemented MVVM pattern with proper state management with **Flutter BLOC** and **Firebase** as backend.
